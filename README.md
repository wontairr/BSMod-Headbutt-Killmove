# BSMod-Headbutt-Killmove
Garry's Mod Addon.
--
HOW TO INSTALL: Put the bsmodheatbutt folder into your addons folder (ex: (steamlocation)\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons ) then run the game.

(WARNING!: If you do not have the BSMod Punch SWEP + Kick & KillMoves addon, this mod will not function.)

HOW TO USE: Using console, type "bind x bsmod_killmove" (without quotes, and x can be whatever key you want.) and then hit enter. 
Now whenever you press that key on an enemy it does the killmove.

To make it so that you can killmove whenever you want, check the spawnmenu for BSMOD settings.
